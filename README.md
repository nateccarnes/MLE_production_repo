# Analysis of Capstone Project for UCSD Machine Learning Engineering Bootcamp

This project aims to predict hospital readmissions (within 30 days) for patients with mental, behavioral, and developmental disorders. The data is from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP); the data will not be shared in this repository because the HCUP Data Use Agreement restricts the sharing of this sensitive database to protect the privacy of patients and partners. A DL model was fit to the training data and yielded relatively poor classification metrics on the test data despite extensive tuning and refinement. This repository contains the production code for this project that can be run end-to-end from the command line with access to cleaned HCUP data (i.e., data that has been aggregated, reduced, and prepared).
